# Notes: 
- Typically, I will solve easy problems in Python3, but I will also solve in C++ or Java sometimes. 
- I still cannot solve LeetCode hard problems, so I will break down another user's solution through comments to demonstrate my understanding.

  ## Currently I've solved:
  - 3 problems in C++
  - 2 problems in Java
  - 20 problems in Python
